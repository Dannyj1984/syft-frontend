This is my ever evolving final project from my computing degree. I worked on creating a web application for my golf society to make the day to day runnuing of the society more efficient.

This repo consists of all the code for the frontend which is written in Javascript using the React library. Part of my final project was improving my knowledge on areas worked on during my degree. I had a good understanding of Javascript and after research settled on using react for the projects frontend. 

The frontend communicates with a Spring backend, making API calls to get data via axios. This data is then displayed dynamically. There are several user roles in the application and the data and options displayed is dependant on the user's role.

I am still learning all that react has to offer and constantly updating parts of the app.
